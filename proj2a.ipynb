    "## This Assignment\n",
    "In project 2, you will use what you've learned in class to create a classifier that can distinguish spam (junk or commercial or bulk) emails from ham (non-spam) emails. In addition to providing some skeleton code to fill in, we will evaluate your work based on your model's accuracy and your written responses in this notebook.\n",

    "- Feature engineering with text data\n",
    "- Using sklearn libraries to process data and fit models\n",
    "- Validating the performance of your model and minimizing overfitting\n",
    "- Generating and analyzing precision-recall curves\n",
    "\n",
    "In project 2A, you will undersatand the data through EDAs and do some basic feature engineerings. At the end, you will train your first logistic regression model to classify Spam/Ham emails. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Warning\n",
    "We've tried our best to filter the data for anything blatantly offensive as best as we can, but unfortunately there may still be some examples you may find in poor taste. If you encounter these examples and believe it is inappropriate for students, please let a TA know and we will try to remove it for future semesters. Thanks for your understanding!"
